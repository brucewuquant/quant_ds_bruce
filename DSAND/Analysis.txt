Run Time Analysis: Big O notation
# Task0
O(1) Since getting element in Python list is O(1)

# Task1 
O(n)
Since update is O(n) and list comprehension is 2*O(n) = O(n)

# Task2 
O(n) since we need to loop through lists.
Get element is O(1) so overall is O(n)

# Task3
O(nlogn) as sort is used. All other loop/get item is O(1) or O(n)

# Task4
O(nlogn). Again, we sort the list. All other loop/get item is O(1) or O(n)
