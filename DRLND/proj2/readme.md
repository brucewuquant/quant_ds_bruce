The Environment
===============

For this project, you will work with the
[Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher)
environment.

[](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd893/parts/286e7d2c-e00c-4146-a5f2-a490e0f23eda/modules/089d6d51-cae8-4d4b-84c6-9bbe58b8b869/lessons/5b822b1d-5c89-4fd5-9b52-a02ddcfd3385/concepts/540e7c18-6831-417e-981c-309c3ffedd56#)

![Unity ML-Agents Reacher
Environment](./Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Nanodegree%20-%20Udacity_files/reacher.gif)

Unity ML-Agents Reacher Environment

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations.
A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in
the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its
position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to
position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each
action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable
to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number
between -1 and 1.

Distributed Training
--------------------

* * * * *

For this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the
Unity environment:

-   The first version contains a single agent.
-   The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own
    copy of the environment.

The second version is useful for algorithms like
[PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf),
[A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and
[D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple
(non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the
task of gathering experience.

Solving the Environment
-----------------------

* * * * *

Note that your project submission need only solve one of the two
versions of the environment.

### Option 1: Solve the First Version

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent
must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Option 2: Solve the Second Version

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is
slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents. In
particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100
consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically,

-   After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received
    (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 20
    (potentially different) scores. We then take the average of these 20
    scores.
-   This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average
    is over all 20 agents).

As an example, consider the plot below, where we have plotted the
**average score** (over all 20 agents) obtained with each episode.

![Plot of average scores (over all agents) with each
episode.](./Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Nanodegree%20-%20Udacity_files/unknown.png)

Plot of average scores (over all agents) with each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100
episodes) of those **average scores** is at least +30. In the case of
the plot above, the environment was solved at episode 63, since the
average of the **average scores** from episodes 64 to 163 (inclusive)
was greater than +30.
